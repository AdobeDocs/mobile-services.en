Information to help you get starting with the Windows 8.1 Universal App Store SDK for Experience Cloud Solutions.

Complete the tasks in [Developer Quick Start](/help/windows-appstore/c-getting-started/dev-qs.md) to add the Windows 8.1 Universal App Store SDK to your project. Next, review the [ADBMobile Class and Method Reference](/help/windows-appstore/c-configuration) and then implement [Analytics](/help/windows-appstore/analytics/analytics.md), [Target](/help/windows-appstore/target/target.md), and [Audience Management](/help/windows-appstore/target/target.md).

If you are upgrading from a previous version, you'll want to take a look at the [Migration Guide](/help/windows-appstore/migration-v3.md).
