# Developer quick start {#developer-quick-start}

You'll need Visual Studio 2013 or later to implement the SDK.

## Get the SDK {#section_99FE1A17A36D4A2C943939023CF6265C}

After you unzip the [SDK download](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/mobile-services/releases), you'll have a separate folder for each supported architecture and platform combination. You will also have an `ADBMobileConfig.json` file that is explained later in this guide.

## Select the correct version {#section_E53C5AA7D5474824A89BB32C003865A1}

Different `.dll`/ `.winmd` files are provided for each target platform (Windows 8.1, Windows Phone 8.1), and supported architecture (x86, x64, ARM). The files are separated into a folder structure according to the following: 

![](assets/folder-structure.png)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>The version of `ADBMobile.winmd` does not reflect the version of the library. The `.winmd` file contains metadata only, and as such will have a version number of `255.255.255.255` which is accepted behavior according to Microsoft (see [How do I add assembly information for a WinRT C++ / CX component dll?](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/en-US/6bcccaee-aa53-4770-bd5b-1205977f1ca7/how-do-i-add-assembly-information-for-a-winrt-c-cx-component-dll?forum=winappswithnativecode)). To check the version of the library you are using, check the version of the underlying `ADBMobile.dll` file.

## Syntax differences {#section_A02DE120B6D240F5AFFE7509755C4F14}

The Windows 8.1 Universal App Store library can be used in several programming languages. The examples in this guide are in WinJS (JavaScript), and might need to be modified if you are using a different language. Note that when you consume winmd methods from winJS (JavaScript), all methods automatically have their first letter lowercased.

The main difference between the implementations is the data structure used for context data.

Additionally, when using the SDK in a WinJS project, use an empty string ( `""` or `''`) instead of `null` for empty string values.

## Add the library and config file to your project - C Sharp {#section_93C25D893B4A4CD3B996CF3C5590C8DC}

1. Launch Visual Studio and open your solution. 
1. In the **Solution Explorer**, right-click **[!UICONTROL References]** and select **[!UICONTROL Add Reference]**.

1. With **[!UICONTROL File Properties]** selected, ensure **[!UICONTROL Package Action]** is set to **[!UICONTROL Content]**.

    For JavaScript projects, the file is set to **[!UICONTROL Content]** by default.

## Update the ADBMobileConfig.json config file {#section_0BC8CC0E4AAD4AC385FA0AEDC3C56AFE}

The `ADBMobileConfig.json` file contains global SDK settings, and is located at your project root after you complete the steps in the *Add the Library and Config File to your Project* section. If your `ADBMobileConfig.json` file was not pre-configured by Adobe Mobile Services, you need to update a few values to get started.

The following is an example of an `ADBMobileConfig.json` file:

```js
{ 
    "version" : "1.0", 
    "analytics" : { 
        "rsids" : "coolApp", 
        "server" : "my.CoolApp.com", 
        "charset" : "UTF-8", 
        "ssl" : true, 
        "offlineEnabled" : true, 
        "lifecycleTimeout" : 300, 
        "privacyDefault" : "optedin", 
        "poi" : [ 
                    ["san francisco",37.757144,-122.44812,7000], 
                    ["santa cruz",36.972935,-122.01725,600] 
                ] 
    }, 
 "target" : { 
  "clientCode" : "myTargetClientCode", 
  "timeout" : 1 
 }, 
 "audienceManager" : { 
  "server" : "myServer.demdex.com" 
 } 
}
```

At a minimum, update the following values for the Solutions you are using:

* **Analytics**: `rsids` and `server` 
* **Target**: `clientCode` 
* **Audience Management**: `server`

For more details, see [ADBMobileConfig.json config](/help/windows-appstore/c-configuration/methods.md).

## Debugging {#section_3A10376A60394A15BEE483323E0CD4AA}

When you want to enable debugging for the SDK, you have to call `ADBMobile.Config.setDebugLogging(true);`.

For C Sharp and JS apps, you have to enable native code debugging by completing the following steps (native code debugging is the default setting for C++ apps):

### C Sharp

Right-click the project, select **[!UICONTROL Properties]** > **[!UICONTROL Debug tab]**. In the debugger drop-down, select **[!UICONTROL Native Only]**.

### JS

Right-click the project, select  **[!UICONTROL Properties]** > **[!UICONTROL Configuration Properties]** > **[!UICONTROL Debug tab]**. Change the debugger type drop down to **Native Only**.

That's it! You're now ready to implement Analytics, Target, and Audience Management in your Windows 8.1 Universal App Store app.
