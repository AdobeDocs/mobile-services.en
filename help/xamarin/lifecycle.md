# Implement lifecycle {#implement-lifecycle}

Information to help you implement Lifecycle metrics for Android. Lifecycle metrics are automatically collected for iOS.

For the metrics and dimensions that can be measured automatically by the mobile library after lifecycle is implemented, see [Lifecycle Metrics](/help/ios/metrics.md).

## iOS

In iOS, lifecycle metrics are automatically collected.

## Android

In your main activity, you need to set the application context for the Android SDK.

```java
protected override void OnCreate (Bundle bundle) 
{
    ... 
    Config.SetContext (Application.Context); 
    ... 
}
```

In every activity, you need to implement lifecycle calls.

```java
protected override void OnResume()
{
    ...
    Config.CollectLifecycleData (this);
    ...
}
protected override void OnPause() 
{
    ...
    Config.PauseCollectingLifecycleData ();
    ...
}
```
