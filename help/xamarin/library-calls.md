# Making calls to the library{#making-calls-to-the-library}

This information to help you make calls to the plugin from your scripts.

When you want to make calls to the plugin from your scripts, you must import the namespace.

By using `Com.Adobe.Mobile`:

* **iOS**: After you import the namespace, you can make calls directly to the SDK via the static methods in the `ADBMobile` classes. 

* **Android**: You can make calls directly to the SDK via the static methods in the `Config/Analytics/Target/AudienceManager/Media`classes.
