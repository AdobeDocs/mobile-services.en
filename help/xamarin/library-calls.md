# Making calls to the library{#making-calls-to-the-library}

Information to help you make calls to the plugin from your scripts.

When you want to make calls to the plugin from your scripts, you must import the namespace.

Using [!DNL Com.Adobe.Mobile]:

* **iOS**: Once you have imported the namespace, you can make calls directly to the SDK via the static methods of the `ADBMobile` classes. 

* **Android**: You can make calls directly to the SDK via the static methods of the `Config/Analytics/Target/AudienceManager/Media`classes.
