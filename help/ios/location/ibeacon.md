# iBeacon tracking {#ibeacon-tracking}

iBeacon tracking allows you to measure and target micro locations using iBeacon and Low Energy Bluetooth.

The following beacon data is sent to Analytics and Target when `trackBeacon` is called:

* `a.beacon.uuid` - ProximityUUID of the beacon 
* `a.beacon.major` - Major number of the beacon, such as store number 
* `a.beacon.minor` - Minor number of the beacon, such as a unique number in a store 
* `a.beacon.prox` - The following values represent how close the user is to the beacon:

  * `0` is unknown 
  * `1` is immediate 
  * `2` is near 
  * `3` is far

## Tracking iBeacons {#section_FC3F213545944A468B1E6D5D5C8E2F1F}

1. Add the library to your project and implement lifecycle.

    For more information, see *Add the SDK and Config File to your Project* in [Core Implementation and Lifecycle](/help/ios/getting-started/dev-qs.md). 
1. Import the library: 

   ```objective-c
   #import "ADBMobile.h"
   ```

1. When a device is within the proximity of a beacon, call `trackBeacon`: 

   ```objective-c
   [ADBMobile trackBeacon:beacon data:nil];
   ```

1. When the user leaves the proximity of the beacon, clear the current beacon: 

   ```objective-c
   [ADBMobile trackingClearCurrentBeacon];
   ```

## Sending Additional Data {#section_3EBE813E54A24F6FB669B2478B5661F9}

In addition to the timed action name, you can send additional context data with each track action call:

```objective-c
[ADBMobile trackBeacon:beacon data:@{@"myapp.ImageLiked" : imageName}];
```

Context data values must be mapped to custom variables:

## Examples {#section_9749238BCBC148998CB18E97D7670D19}

```objective-c
- (void)locationManager:(CLLocationManager *)manager didRangeBeacons:(NSArray *)beacons inRegion:(CLBeaconRegion *)region { 
    if (beacons.count > 0) { 
        CLBeacon *beacon = beacons[0]; 
        // Adobe - track when in range of a beacon 
        [ADBMobile trackBeacon:beacon data:@{@"sampleContextData" : @"sampleContextDataVal"}]; 
    } 
} 
 
// When the user leaves the proximity of the beacon, clear the current beacon 
[ADBMobile trackingClearCurrentBeacon];
```
