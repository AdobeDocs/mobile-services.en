Release notes and known issues for iOS SDKs 4.x for Experience Cloud Solutions.

**Mobile Services**

Release date: **January 17, 2019**

New features, updates, and fixes to the Android SDKs:

* **iOS version 4.18.0**

  * **Configuration**: Added a new API to allow overriding internal NSURLSession parameters.

  * **Adobe Target**: Fixed a crashing bug caused when multiple loadRequests calls were being made consecutively in environments with poor network connectivity.

  * **In-App Messaging**: Fixed an issue that would sometimes allow show-once local notifications to show more than once if their conditions were triggered quickly in succession.
