Some information to remember:

* iOS 5 or later is supported

  For iOS 11 or later, you **must** have SDK version 4.13.8 or later. 

* In version 4.2 of this SDK and later, all hits are now sent using HTTP POST.

  This has no impact on the data that is collected or reported, but you need to use a packet analyzer that supports inspecting POST data to view hits.

* If you are upgrading from a previous version (2.x or 3.x), see the [4.x Migration Guide](/help/ios/getting-started/migration-v3.md).
