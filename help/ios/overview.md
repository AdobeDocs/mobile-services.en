# iOS SDK 4.x for Experience Cloud Solutions{#ios-sdk-x-for-experience-cloud-solutions}

iOS SDK 4.x for Experience Cloud Solutions lets you measure native Apple iPhone and iPad applications, deliver targeted content within your apps, and leverage and collect audience data through Audience Manager.

Some information to remember:

* iOS 5 or later is supported

  For iOS 11 or later, you **must** have SDK version 4.13.8 or later. 

* In version 4.2 of this SDK and later, all hits are now sent using HTTP POST.

  This has no impact on the data that is collected or reported, but you'll need to use a packet analyzer that supports inspecting POST data to view hits, such as [Bloodhound](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mobile/bloodhound/).

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  >As of April 30, 2017, Adobe Bloodhound has been sunset. Starting on May 1, 2017, no additional enhancements and no additional Engineering or Adobe Expert Care support will be provided.

* If you are upgrading from a previous version (2.x or 3.x), see the [4.x Migration Guide](getting-started/migration-v3.md#concept_F3ED480E38D64396A80048AA45FC6849).
