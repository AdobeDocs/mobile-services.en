# Event Serialization {#event-serialization}

Event serialization is not supported by processing rules. In the Mobile SDK, you must use a special syntax in the context data parameter to set serialized events directly on the server call.

```java
cdata.put("&&events", "event1:12341234");
```

For example:

```java
//create a context data dictionary 
HashMap cdata = new HashMap<String, Object>(); 
 
// add events 
cdata.put("&&events", "event1:12341234"); 
 
// send the tracking call - use either a trackAction or TrackState call. 
// trackAction example: 
Analytics.trackAction("action", cdata); 
// trackState example: 
Analytics.trackState("State Name", cdata);
```
