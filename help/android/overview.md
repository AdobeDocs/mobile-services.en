# Android SDK 4.x for Experience Cloud Solutions{#android-sdk-x-for-experience-cloud-solutions}

Android SDK 4.x for Experience Cloud Solutions allows you to measure native Android applications, deliver targeted content in your app, and leverage and collect audience data through audience management.

The SDKs support the following versions of Android:

* Version 4.6.0 or earlier supports Android 2.2(API 8) - Android 5.1.1 (API 22) 
* Version 4.6.1 or later supports Android 2.3(API 9) or later

Some information to remember:

* In version 4.2 and later, all hits are now sent using HTTP POST.

  This has no impact on the data that is collected or reported, but you need to use a packet analyzer that supports inspecting POST data to view hits, such as the [Bloodhound 3.x for Mac](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mobile/bloodhound/).

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >
  >As of April 30, 2017, Adobe Bloodhound has been sunset. Starting on May 1, 2017, no additional enhancements and no additional Engineering or Adobe Expert Care support will be provided.

* If you are upgrading from a previous version, see the [4.x Migration Guide](getting-started/migration-v3.md#concept_F3ED480E38D64396A80048AA45FC6849).
