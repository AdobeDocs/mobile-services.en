      Select your organization from the drop-down list.
      An [!UICONTROL]Experience Cloud organization is the entity that enables an administrator to configure groups and users, and to control single sign-on in the [!UICONTROL]Experience Cloud. The organization functions like a log-in company that spans all the Experience Cloud products and solutions. Typically, the organization is your company's name, but a company might have many organizations.
