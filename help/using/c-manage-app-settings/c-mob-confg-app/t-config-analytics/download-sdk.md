## App SDK downloads {#section_F647A95C96B0439BA276781E0C97C689}

You can download an `ADBMobileConfig.json` file that is customized with the app settings you have selected. For example, the configuration file is pre-populated with your report suite ID, tracking server, and the HTTPS, default privacy setting, and session timeout you selected on this screen.

>If you download the mobile SDK, the customized `ADBMobileConfig.json` file is automatically included.
