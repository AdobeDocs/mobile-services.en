This informaton Information to help you download Mobile Services SDKs and tools to help you with your Mobile Services implementation.

## App SDK Downloads {#section_F647A95C96B0439BA276781E0C97C689}

You can download an [!DNL ADBMobileConfig.json] file that is customized with the app settings you have selected. For example, the configuration file is pre-populated with your report suite ID, tracking server, and the HTTPS, default privacy setting, and session timeout you selected on this screen.

If you download the mobile SDK, the customized [!DNL ADBMobileConfig.json] file is included automatically.

## Native Libraries {#section_C2ADC3068D9F4EAEBE5B266852738C90}

Configure your app in Adobe Mobile services so you can download a customized package that includes a pre-populated version of the configuration file. [iOS instructions](/help/ios/getting-started/requirements.md) | [Android instructions](/help/android/getting-started/requirements.md)
