You can configure the SDK Audience Manager options on the Manage App Settings page while creating a new app or editing an existing app.

1. While adding a new app or editing an existing app, type information in the **[!UICONTROL Subdomain]** field under **[!UICONTROL SDK Options]**.

1. Type the subdomain of the Audience Manager server that your app uses, for example, `client.demdex.net`. 

    If you are not using Adobe Audience Manager, leave this field blank.
