# Roles and permissions{#roles-and-permissions}

In Adobe Analytics, you can manage roles on the Admin Tools Home page.

## Overview {#section_91B8192891E14E5285718C8118912500}

The following roles manage permissions in the Mobile Services UI:

### Analytics Admin

An Analytics Admin manages user groups and assigns permissions, one of which is the Mobile App Admin. The Experience Cloud Admin links your Adobe ID to your Adobe Analytics account, which allows you to log in to the Mobile Services UI by using your Adobe ID. For more information about the Experience Cloud Administrator, see [Administration - User Management and FAQ](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/core-services/interface/manage-users-and-products/admin-getting-started.html).

>[!TIP]
>
>An existing Analytics Admin has the ability to assign the Analytics Admin role to any user.

For more information about this role, see the following content:

* [User and Group permission changes](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/analytics/admin/user-product-management/user-management/permissions-changes.html)

### Mobile App Admin

This role is the Admin for the Mobile Services UI.

## Managing access {#section_E6939C2695AA4A0DBF432D50B2670920}

Here is some additional information about accessing options in the Mobile Services UI:

### Apps and report suites

All Mobile Service apps are tied to report suites. If users do not have access to a report suite, they will not have access to that report suite's associated app.

### Mobile Services and Analytics features

If your company does not have an Analytics contract to access a feature in the UI, such as Push Messaging, no user in your company will have access to that feature, regardless of permission level.
