# Display Mobile Metrics {#display-mobile-metrics}

You can display the key performance metrics of the apps that you most recently viewed. By default, you can view up to 12 apps. You can change the date range and create filters to segment the data and edit any app on the Overview page.

The metrics that display for each app reflect the key metrics that you selected when you created the app. For more information, see [Add a New App](/help/using/manage-apps/t-new-app.md).

If the app you want to view is not displayed, search for it by typing the app's name or by clicking the drop-down list in **[!UICONTROL All Apps]**.

You can perform the following tasks on the Overview page:

## Change Date Range {#section_E9ED7BB941EC48B58DF938C831493CD5}

The previous 30 days of data displays for key metrics. You can change this by clicking the calendar icon in the top right-hand side. You can select a date range or a pre-determined time frame from the drop-down list.

## Filter Data {#section_83786CBDB69644E3BC4EBC66C35B3FE8}

You can user filters to segment the data for each app.

For example you can filter the data by App Version and by Device Type.

To create a filter:

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Filter]** icon to display the **[!UICONTROL Sticky Filter]** dialog box.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Rule]**, select an option from the drop-down list, and type the necessary information.

    For example, you might select **[!UICONTROL App Version]** and type `4.5` for the version. You could select **[!UICONTROL Device Type]** and type `Android`.

    >[!TIP]
    >
    >You can create complex filters by using *AND* and *OR* statements.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Update]**.

>[!TIP]
>
>A blue bubble displays next to the **[!UICONTROL Filter]** icon to indicate the number of active filters.

To cancel filters, click the **[!UICONTROL Filter]** icon, and click **[!UICONTROL Cancel]**.

## Display Key Performance Indicators {#section_44EFF65D62DC43BB8371EA5965942CED}

Click the name of the app to display details about the key performance indicators. The lines on the chart are color coded, and you can mouse over the data point to display the statistics for specific dates. To drill down, click the **[!UICONTROL >]** icon next to **[!UICONTROL Key Performance Indicators]**. The lines on the chart are color coded, and you can mouse over any data point to see statistics for specific dates. Click a column header in the table to sort the data in ascending or descending order.
