# Marketing Links Builder

The builder helps you build marketing links that can route users to app stores and app or web link destinations. Marketers can choose destinations based on rules, such as device type or operating system of the user’s device.

The marketing links can be tracked and reported on, allowing marketers to attribute downloads, app relaunches, and other in-app events to these links.
