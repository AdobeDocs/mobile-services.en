>To create and use marketing links, you must first create link destinations. For more information, see[ Create or Edit Marketing Links](../../acquisition_main/c_marketing-links-builder/t_create-edit-adobe-links/t_create-edit-adobe-links.md#task_154A125591904CA598DF9391A44C081C). 



On the [!UICONTROL  Marketing Links] page, you can complete the following tasks: 


* **Display marketing links** 

  To display the list of marketing links, in the [!UICONTROL  Mobile Services] home page, click **[!UICONTROL  Acquisition]** > **[!UICONTROL  Marketing Links Builder]** **[!UICONTROL]**. 

  The **[!UICONTROL  Clicks]** column displays the number of users who have clicked on the marketing link. The **[!UICONTROL  First Launches]** column displays the number of first launches for the app. This value reflects the number of users who chose to install the app and launch it after clicking on the marketing link. 

* **Archive or Unarchive marketing links** 

    * To archive a marketing link, select the check box next to a link and click **[!UICONTROL  Archive Selected]**. 

    * To unarchive a marketing clink, click **[!UICONTROL  View Archive]**, select at least one link and click **[!UICONTROL  Unarchive Selected]**. Only previously archived marketing links will display in the [!UICONTROL  View Archive] page.
