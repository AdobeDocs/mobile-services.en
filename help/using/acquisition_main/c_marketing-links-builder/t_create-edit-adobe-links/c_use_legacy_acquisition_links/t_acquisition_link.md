# Create an Acquisition Link

You can create app store links that let you download applications directly from the Apple App Store and Google Play. The links you create let you attribute your success events to the downloads.

<!-- I'm confused by this procedure. In the UI, there is no "Manage Acquisition Link" option under "Acquisition". Also the 4 final options listed in the table below appear only when you click "+" next to "Add Tracking Context Data". Should this procedure be removed? -->

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Acquisition]** > **[!UICONTROL Manage Acquisition Links]** > **[!UICONTROL Create New]**.
1. Type the following information in the **[!UICONTROL Link Information]** section:

<table id="table_CFCEED0575D94FD4A1433B870FA8FDB7"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> Field </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> Description </th> 
  </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Name </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>(Required) Specify a descriptive name for the app link. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Tracking Code </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Specify the desired tracking code or click <span class="uicontrol"> Generate</span> to create a new tracking code. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Source </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>(Required) Specify the original referrer, such as "newsletter" or "homepage." </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Medium </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Specify the marketing medium, such as "banner" or "email." </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Content </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Specify the name or ID of the ad with the link. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p>Term </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>Specify paid terms or other search terms for the ad. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody>

   >The values in the above fields cannot be changed after the acquisition link is created.
