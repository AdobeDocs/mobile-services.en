# Delete Acquisition Links

You can delete one or more acquisition links when they are no longer needed.

<!-- I'm confused by this procedure. In the UI, there is no "Manage Acquisition Link" option under "Acquisition". I don't see any other way to delete a link...am I missing something? Should this procedure be removed? -->

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Acquisition]** > **[!UICONTROL Manage Acquisition Links]**.
1. Complete one of the following tasks:

* Select the check box next to one or more acquisition links. 
* Select the check box in the header to select all of your acquisition links.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Delete Selected]** and confirm the deletion.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >The **[!UICONTROL Delete Selection]** option does not display until you select one or more acquisition links.
