# Digital Publishing Solution

You can view reports that are available to Digital Publishing Solution (DPS) customers.

DPS reports allow you to track the user data of your custom viewer app from [!DNL Mobile Services]. When you subscribe to the Adobe Digital Publishing Suite with a Professional or Enterprise account, you get access to base-level analytics for all your apps.

Apps that are created from DPS have access to the Adobe Mobile core service user interface through Analytics Essentials - DPS.

For more information, see [DPS Analytics in the Digital Publishing Solution Help](https://helpx.adobe.com/digital-publishing-suite/help/omniture-analytics.html).
