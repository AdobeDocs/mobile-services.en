# Digital Publishing Solution

DPS reports allow you to track the user data of your custom viewer app from [!DNL  Mobile Services]. When you subscribe to the Adobe Digital Publishing Suite with a Professional or Enterprise account, you get access to base-level analytics for all your apps. 

Apps that are created from DPS have access to the Adobe Mobile core service user interface through Analytics Essentials - DPS. 

For more information, see [ DPS Analytics in the Digital Publishing Solution Help ](https://helpx.adobe.com/digital-publishing-suite/help/omniture-analytics.html).
