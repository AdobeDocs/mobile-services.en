By default, this report shows the number of readers who shared articles in different channels, such as email, message, and so on.

This report is similar to the **[!UICONTROL Technology]** report. For information about how to navigate and use sunburst reports; add breakdowns and metrics; create target activities; create sticky filters, and share reports, see [Technology](//help/using/usage/reports-technology.md). The information in the Technology topic can be used to customize the **[!UICONTROL Social Sharing]** report.
