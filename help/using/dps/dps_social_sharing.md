# Social Sharing

![](assets/dps_social_share.png) 

By default, this report shows the number of readers who shared articles in different channels, such as email, message, and so on. 

This report is similar to the **[!UICONTROL  Technology]** report. For information about how to navigate and use sunburst reports; add breakdowns and metrics; create target activities; create sticky filters, and share reports, see [ Technology ](../usage/reports_technology.md#concept_FA595B66323E47AE8EC785D2184F2951). The information in the Technology topic can be used to customize the **[!UICONTROL  Social Sharing]** report.
