        Provide a URI schema deep link (for example, `yourapp://section`). App deep link destinations are URI schema deep links that direct users to a deep link in your app. For example, you can direct users to a specific product line in an online retailer's mobile app.
  
      * **[UICONTROL Web Link]**  
  
        Type a web HTTP or HTTPS URL, for example,`https://adobe.com`. Web link destinations direct users to a URL. For example, you can direct users to a product line on an online retailer's website.
  
      * **[!UICONTROL Hybrid Link]**

        Type an iOS Universal Link or an Android App Link (for example, `https://yourwebsite.com`). Hybrid links support iOS Universal Links or Android App Links.
