# Acquisition Prerequisites{#acquisition-prerequisites}

Complete the following prerequisites before you use acquisition links.

To track marketing links, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:

   You must create a new mobile app report suite or have an existing report suite that can collect, track, and report on data that is collected from your marketing links. For more information about creating a new mobile app report suite, see [Add New App](/help/using/manage-apps/t-new-app.md). 

1. Verify your SDK version.
