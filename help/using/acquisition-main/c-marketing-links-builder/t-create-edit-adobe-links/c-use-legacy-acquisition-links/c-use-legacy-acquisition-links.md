# Use Legacy Acquisition Links{#use-legacy-acquisition-links}

This information helps you use legacy acquisition links.

>[!TIP]
>
>This feature requires SDK version 4.1 or later with acquisition enabled. For more information, see [Acquisition configuration](/help/using/acquisition-main/t-enable-acquisition.md). You must also specify who has Mobile App Admin rights, because these rights enables access to acquisition links and in-app messages. For more information, see [Roles and permissions](/help/using/gs/c-mob-roles-and-permissions.md).

The Legacy Acquisition builder allows you to create app store links that allow users to directly download applications from the Apple App Store and Google Play. These links allow you to attribute your success events to the downloads.
