# Use Legacy Acquisition Links{#use-legacy-acquisition-links}

This information helps you use the legacy acquisition link functionality.

>[!TIP]
>
>This feature requires SDK version 4.1 or later with acquisition enabled. For more information, see [Acquisition Configuration](../../../../acquisition-main/t-enable-acquisition.md#task_5832F50B28DB44F5A9E6DBB7B6D6FD2A). You must also specify who has Mobile App Admin rights, because these rights enables access to acquisition links and in-app messages. For more information, see [Roles and Permissions](../../../../gs/c-mob-roles-and-permissions.md#concept_B1EC13F686F742D1AD7025C38F60A70D).

The Legacy Acquisition builder lets you create app store links that allow users to download applications directly from the Apple App Store and Google Play. The links you create enable you to attribute your success events to the downloads.
