# Import or Export Acquisition Links{#import-or-export-acquisition-links}

Import or export acquisition links if you would rather work with the links using a .csv file instead of using the Adobe Mobile Services user interface.

<!-- 

I'm confused by this procedure. In the UI, there is no "Manage Acquisition Link" option under "Acquisition". I don't see options to import or export. Should this procedure be removed?

 -->

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Acquisition]** > **[!UICONTROL Manage Acquisition Links]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Import]** and complete one of the following tasks:

    * Browse to and select the desired file to upload into Mobile Services. 
    * Click **[!UICONTROL Export]** and open or save the file.
