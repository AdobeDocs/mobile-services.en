You can use the Marketing Links page to create, use, and archive marketing links.

>[!NOTE] {othertype="Prerequisite"}

>To create and use marketing links, you must first create link destinations. For more information, see [Create or Edit Marketing Links](../../acquisition-main/c-marketing-links-builder/t-create-edit-adobe-links/t-create-edit-adobe-links.md#task_154A125591904CA598DF9391A44C081C).

On the [!DNL Marketing Links] page, you can complete the following tasks:

* **Display marketing links**

  To display the list of marketing links, in the [!DNL Mobile Services] home page, click **[!UICONTROL Acquisition]** > **[!UICONTROL Marketing Links Builder]** **[!UICONTROL]**.

  The **[!UICONTROL Clicks]** column displays the number of users who have clicked on the marketing link. The **[!UICONTROL First Launches]** column displays the number of first launches for the app. This value reflects the number of users who chose to install the app and launch it after clicking on the marketing link. 

* **Archive or Unarchive marketing links**

    * To archive a marketing link, select the check box next to a link and click **[!UICONTROL Archive Selected]**. 
    * To unarchive a marketing clink, click **[!UICONTROL View Archive]**, select at least one link and click **[!UICONTROL Unarchive Selected]**. Only previously archived marketing links will display in the [!DNL View Archive] page.
