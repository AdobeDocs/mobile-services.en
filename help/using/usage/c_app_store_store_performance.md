# App Store Overview Report

The App Store Overview report gives you a snapshot of your app store metrics, including the number of downloads, in-app purchases, app store average rating, download revenue, in-app revenue, downloads by country, downloads by app store, and in-app purchases by name.

>[!TIP]
>
>In the Mobile Services UI, the **[!UICONTROL App Store]** menu item and **[!UICONTROL Overview]** report appear in the left navigation menu after you configure the integration.

The **[!UICONTROL Overview]** report contains an over-time graph that displays information about the number of app store downloads, in-app purchases made by using your app, and your app's average rating.

You can click any metric to hide or display its corresponding line. To view the data for a day, hover over that day.

>[!NOTE]
>
>App store metrics, such as downloads, rank, revenue, rating, and so on in Adobe Analytics require a Data Connector integration with an appropriate vendor. `appFigures` currently provides an integration, which requires purchasing the appropriate product and/or service from `appFigures` **before** you can enable the integration. For more information about Data Connector integrations, see [Adobe Exchange](https://www.adobeexchange.com/experiencecloud.html).

The following information displays below the graph:
