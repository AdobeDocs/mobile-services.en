# Add Filters to Reports


>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Mobile app metrics are also available in marketing reports & analytics, ad hoc analysis, data warehouse, and other [!DNL  Analytics] reporting interfaces. If a breakdown or report type is not available in [!DNL  Adobe Mobile], it can be generated by using a different reporting interface. 

In this example, we will customize the [!UICONTROL  Users &amp; Sessions] report, but the instructions apply to any report. 

>1. Open your app and click  **[!UICONTROL  Usage]** > **[!UICONTROL  Users &amp; Sessions]** .
>   ![Step Result](assets/customize1.png) 

>   This report provides a complete overtime view of our app users. However, metrics for both the iOS and Android versions of this app are collected in the same report suite. We can segment users by mobile OS by adding a custom filter to the Users metric. 
>
>1. Click **[!UICONTROL  Customize]**.

>       ![Step Result](assets/customize2.png) 
>1. Under **[!UICONTROL  Users]**, click **[!UICONTROL  Add Filter]**and click **[!UICONTROL  Add Rule]**,


>1. Select **[!UICONTROL  Operating Systems]**, and from the drop-down list, and select **[!UICONTROL  iOS]**.
>   ![](assets/customize3.png) 

>   We need to repeat this step to add Android as a filter. 
>
>1. Click **[!UICONTROL  And]**, select **[!UICONTROL  Operating Systems]** from the drop-down list, and select **[!UICONTROL  Android]**.

>       Your filters should now look like the following example: 

>       ![](assets/customize4.png) 
>1. Click **[!UICONTROL  Update]**.
>1. To regenerate the report, click **[!UICONTROL  Run]**.

>       This report now shows users broken down by operating system. The report title was changed to match the filters that were applied to the report. 

>       <a id="fig_036E704A498548389E7B2BE736104323"></a> ![](assets/customize5.png) 

>       We can customize this report more. With the recent launch of iOS 8.3, we can add the [!UICONTROL  First Launches] metric with an iOS 8.3 operating system version filter to see how many customers with iOS 8.3 upgraded their apps and performed a first launch. 
>1. Under **[!UICONTROL  First Launches]**, click **[!UICONTROL  Add Filter]**, click **[!UICONTROL  Add Rule]**, select **[!UICONTROL  Operating Systems]** from the drop-down list, and select **[!UICONTROL  iOS]**.
>1. Click **[!UICONTROL  And]**, select **[!UICONTROL  Operating System Versions]** from the drop-down list, and select **[!UICONTROL  iOS 8.3]**.

>       Your filters should now look like this example: 

>       ![](assets/customize6.png) 
>1. Click **[!UICONTROL  Update]** and **[!UICONTROL  Run]**.

>       This report now shows users with iOS 8.3 who have launched the app for the first time. 

>       <a id="fig_F515EF3B901640A6A431C48D9D9D24C3"></a> ![](assets/customize7.png) 

>       Take some time to test the different options on the report customization menu, and ensure that you bookmark your favorites. Report URLs in [!DNL  Adobe Mobile] are fully functional bookmarks that can be emailed or added to your favorites.
