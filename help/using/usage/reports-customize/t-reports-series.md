# Add Series (Metrics) to Reports{#add-series-metrics-to-reports}

This information helps you customize the built-in reports by adding additional series (metrics) or apps in different report suites to compare data.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Mobile app metrics are also available in marketing reports & analytics, ad hoc analysis, data warehouse, and other [!DNL Analytics] reporting interfaces. If a breakdown or report type is not available in [!DNL Adobe Mobile], it can be generated by using a different reporting interface.

In this example, we will customize the [!DNL Users & Sessions] report, but the instructions apply to any report. 

1. Open your app and click **[!UICONTROL Usage]** > **[!UICONTROL Users & Sessions]**.

   This report provides a complete overtime view of our app users. However, we want to add a series to report on app crashes. 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Customize]**.

   ![Step Result](assets/customize2.png)

1. Scroll down and click **[!UICONTROL Add Series]**.

   The name of the series is populated with the same name as the last series in your list. In the previous illustration, the latest series is **[!UICONTROL App Store Downloads]**, so a new series is added and is also titled **[!UICONTROL App Store Downloads]**. 
1. Complete one of the following tasks:

    * To add a new series (metric), click the name of the series you just created and select a new Lifecycle metric from the drop-down list.

    * To add a new app (in a different report suite) so that you can compare data across apps, click the app name in the newly created series and select the desired app.
