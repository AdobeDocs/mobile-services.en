# Customize Reports{#customize-reports}

This information helps you understand and customize the built-in reports.

You can customize your reports by changing the date range, the **[!UICONTROL Show By]** options (display graph and table data by time periods or by dimensions), add metrics and filters, add additional series (metrics), and more.

To display the [!DNL Customize] rail, click the name of the app to go to its [!DNL Overview] page, and click **[!UICONTROL Customize]**.

The following example shows the [!DNL Users & Sessions] report with the open **[!UICONTROL Customize]** rail. This example displays data for the last 30 days, shown by days, with four active series:

* **[!UICONTROL Users]** 
* **[!UICONTROL Launches]** 
* **[!UICONTROL First Launches]** 
* **[!UICONTROL App Store Downloads]**

The following information describes each area of the report and the **[!UICONTROL Customize]** rail:
