# Customize reports{#customize-reports}

This information helps you understand and customize the built-in reports.

You can customize your reports by changing the date range, the **[!UICONTROL Show By]** options (display graph and table data by time periods or by dimensions), add metrics and filters, add additional series (metrics), and more.

To display the Customize rail, click the name of the app to go to its Overview page, and click **[!UICONTROL Customize]**.

The following example shows the Users & Sessions report with the open **[!UICONTROL Customize]** rail. This example displays data for the last 30 days, shown by days, with four active series:

* **[!UICONTROL Users]** 
* **[!UICONTROL Launches]** 
* **[!UICONTROL First Launches]** 
* **[!UICONTROL App Store Downloads]**

The following information describes each area of the report and the **[!UICONTROL Customize]** rail: 

| Number | Description |
|--- |--- |
|1|In **[!UICONTROL Date Ranges]**, the drop-down list lets you select various date ranges for your report. All data in the chart (9) and corresponding table (10) respects the selected date range.|
|2|In **[!UICONTROL Show By]**, the drop-down list lets you select a time-based or dimension-based display for your report.  For example, in the illustration, you can see that  Days is selected. If you look at the dates below the chart (7) and the rows in the table (8), data is categorized by date in an over-time report. A maximum of six metrics can be reported on over-time reports by adding additional series to the report.  If you select a Lifecycle dimension, you can view the top 50 values in a ranked list, the top 5 values trended by day or week, or a top 5 or 10 values breakdown.|
|3|**[!UICONTROL Series]** represents individual metrics, such as  Users,  Launches,  First Launches, and  App Store Downloads in the above example. Each series is color coded with data in the chart (7) and table (8).  You can add additional series (metrics) and even different apps in different report suites to compare data.  For more information, see  [Add Series (Metrics) to Reports](/help/using/usage/reports-customize/t-reports-series.md).|
|4|With **[!UICONTROL Add Filter]**, you can customize the built-in reports by adding additional filters (segments).  For more information, see  [Add Filters to Reports](/help/using/usage/reports-customize/t-reports-customize.md).|
|5|With **[!UICONTROL Add Series]**, you can customize the built-in reports by adding additional series (metrics) or apps in different report suites to compare data.  For more information, see [Add Series (Metrics) to Reports](/help/using/usage/reports-customize/t-reports-series.md).|
|6|With **[!UICONTROL Sticky Filter]**, you can create a filter that spans different reports. For example, you might want to see how a particular segment is performing across all mobile reports. A sticky filter lets you define a filter that is applied to all non-pathing reports.  For more information, see [Add Sticky Filter](/help/using/usage/reports-customize/t-sticky-filter.md).|
|7|The **[!UICONTROL Data Chart]** displays data in an appropriate chart based on the selected metrics. Chart types include line charts, bar charts, donut charts, etc.|
|8|The **[!UICONTROL Data Table]** displays data in tabular form. You can click a column header to sort the data in ascending or descending order.|
