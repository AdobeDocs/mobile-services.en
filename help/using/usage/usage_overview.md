The Overview report provides a snapshot of your key metrics.

Here is an example of this report:

You can change the date range for the report by clicking the calendar icon on the top right side. You can also create a [sticky filter](../usage/reports_customize/t_sticky_filter.md#task_75B0AD4D58014BB0A5A09FE1B074ECE1) that spans different reports to see how a segment is performing across all mobile reports.
