The Average Crash Rate graph displays the crash rate by date. You can hover over any date to view the crash rate for that day.

The Crash History chart displays information about each app crash, including the crash ID, crash type, number or crashes, and the crash date. To log in to Apteligent to view more details about a crash, click the link in the **[!UICONTROL Crash ID]** column.

You can configure the following options for this report:

* **[!UICONTROL Time Period]**
    Click the **[!UICONTROL Calendar]** icon to select a custom period or to select a preset time period from the drop-down list.

* **[!UICONTROL Filter]**
    Click **[!UICONTROL Filter]** to create a filter that spans different reports to see how a segment is performing across all mobile reports. A sticky filter allows you to define a filter that is applied to all non-pathing reports. For more information, see [Add Sticky Filter](../usage/reports-customize/t-sticky-filter.md).
