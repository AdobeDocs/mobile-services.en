# Manage Points of Interest

To use [!UICONTROL  Location] features, you must do the following: 


* You must have [!DNL  Analyticsâ€”Mobile Apps] or [!DNL  Analytics Premium]. 

* You must enable **[!UICONTROL  Location Reports]** for the app. 

* If you are using a version of the iOS SDK or Android SDK before 4.2, after adding new **[!UICONTROL  Points of Interest]**, you must download a new configuration file and give it to your app developers. 

  If you are using the [ iOS SDK](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mobile/ios/) or [ Android SDK](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mobile/android/) versions 4.2 or later, you do not need to submit an app update to the store to update your **[!UICONTROL  Points of Interest]**. On the [!UICONTROL  Manage Points of Interest] page, clicking **[!UICONTROL  Save]** packages changes to the **[!UICONTROL  Points of Interest]** list and updates the configuration file for the live app. Saving also updates the list of points in your app on the user devices, as long as the app uses the updated SDK and configuration with a remote points-of-interest URL. 



On the user's device, for a hit to be assigned to a **[!UICONTROL  Points of Interest]**, location must be enabled for the app. 

>1. Click the name of the app to go to its [!UICONTROL  Manage App Settings] **[!UICONTROL]** page.
>1. Click **[!UICONTROL  Location]** > **[!UICONTROL  Manage Points of Interest]**.

>   <!-- In "Manage App Settings" page, I don't see "Location" as an option. I only see the "Manage Points of Interest" tab at the top of the page. -->
