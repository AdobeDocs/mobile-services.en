# Overview (Location)

This report provides a sunburst visualization for your existing data, and you can use the report to discover audience segments (collections of visitors) for targeting. Creating and managing audiences is similar to creating and using segments, except that you can make the audiences available in the [!DNL  Experience Cloud]. 

This section contains the following information: 


* [ Navigation and Usage](../location/c_location_overview.md#section_4A88C3849B5847BF8CF433CCFD99FDC3)
* [ Add Breakdowns and Metrics](../location/c_location_overview.md#section_15833511E82648869E7B1EFC24EF7B82)
* [ Create a Sticky Filter](../location/c_location_overview.md#section_365999D49FC744ECBF9273132497E06C)
* [ Share Reports](../location/c_location_overview.md#section_F8AF2AA73D4C4C008976D45847F82D0B)


## Navigation and Usage {#section_4A88C3849B5847BF8CF433CCFD99FDC3}

This visualization provides, for example, the base report with breakdowns. The visualization uses height to show the metric in focus, and the performance differences between the metrics. Each ring represents an audience segment in the ring's category. You can take actions on an audience, such as applying a Sticky Filter, hiding a metric, and viewing metrics.

## Add Breakdowns and Metrics {#section_15833511E82648869E7B1EFC24EF7B82}

You can add breakdowns and secondary metrics, which change the height of each audience relative to the other audiences in the chart.

>The more rings you add to the sunburst, the longer it takes to process.



To add breakdowns and secondary metrics, click **[!UICONTROL  Location Breakdown]** in the title bar of the report and click **[!UICONTROL  Customize]** to open the right rail.

Click a slice in the ring to select the audience for which you want to create a sticky filter and click **[!UICONTROL  Sticky Filter]**. This sticky filter lets you apply the current filters and run a new report based on the filters.
