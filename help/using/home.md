## Announcing End of Support for 4x SDKs

After September 30, 2020, customers can continue to download and use the version 4 SDKs, but there will be no Customer Care support or access to forums. The Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK (previously referred to as v5) will exclusively support upcoming Adobe Experience Cloud features and functionality. 

Please see end of support [FAQ](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/version-4-sdk-end-of-support-faq) for more details.

We recommend that you migrate to the new Experience Platform Mobile SDK when feasible.

## New Adobe Experience Cloud SDK Release

Looking for information and documentation related to the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDK? Click [here](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/) for our latest documentation.

As of September 2018, we released a new, major version of the SDK. These new Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs are configurable through [Experience Platform Launch](https://www.adobe.com/experience-platform/launch.html).

* To get started, go to Launch.
* To see what is in the Experience Platform SDK repositories, go to [Github: Adobe Experience Platform SDKs](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/acp-sdks).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> If you are using the Adobe Experience Platform Mobile SDKs with Adobe Launch, you **must** also install the Adobe Analytics Mobile Services extension to use Adobe Mobile Services features such as in-App messaging, push notifications or Acquisition links. For more information see [Adobe Analytics - Mobile Services](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/using-mobile-extensions/adobe-analytics-mobile-services).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Although you can configure features in the UI, these features will not work until you download the generated configuration file and add this file to the SDK. For information about downloading and configuring the SDKs, see the *SDK documentation* section on this page.

For the latest release notes, see [Experience Cloud Release Notes](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/release-notes/experience-cloud/current.html).
