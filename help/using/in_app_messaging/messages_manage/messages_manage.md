# Manage Messages

View a list of your in-app and push messages with details about when each message was last updated and whether the messages are live or deactivated.

You can duplicate, activate/deactivate, and archive/unarchive messages. You can also view a report that displays the number of users who have viewed the message and the number of users who have clicked through the message.

To manage messages, click **[!UICONTROL *`<app name>`*]** > **[!UICONTROL Messaging]** > **[!UICONTROL Manage Messages]** .

## Search and Filter Messages {#section_9D7CD24C1B8C46158530C748B7825E10}

Use the Search box at the top of the list to search for and filter messages. Anything you type in the search box displays matching messages from the list. The search works across all table columns. For example, you can type `Draft` to display only messages with that status. You can also type a user's name to display only messages updated by that user.

In addition to the Search box, you can also click any column header to sort the list in ascending or descending order by the contents of that column.

For example, if you sort the **[!UICONTROL Message Type]** column in ascending order, all of your in-app messages display before your push messages. If you sort the **[!UICONTROL Last Updated]** column in descending order, the list displays your most recently updated messages at the top of the list.

1. Select the check box next to one or more messages and click **[!UICONTROL Duplicate Selected]**.
