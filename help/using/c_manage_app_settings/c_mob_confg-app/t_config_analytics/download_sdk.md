# Download Mobile SDKs and Tools

This informaton Information to help you download Mobile Services SDKs and tools to help you with your Mobile Services implementation.

## App SDK Downloads {#section_F647A95C96B0439BA276781E0C97C689}

You can download an [!DNL ADBMobileConfig.json] file that is customized with the app settings you have selected. For example, the configuration file is pre-populated with your report suite ID, tracking server, and the HTTPS, default privacy setting, and session timeout you selected on this screen.

If you download the mobile SDK, the customized [!DNL ADBMobileConfig.json] file is included automatically.
