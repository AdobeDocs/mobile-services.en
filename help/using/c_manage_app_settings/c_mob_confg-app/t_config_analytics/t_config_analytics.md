Session info hits currently consist of crashes and session length. </p> <p> When enabled, the Adobe SDK will backdate the session info hit to 1 second after the last hit of the previous session. This means that crashes and session data will correlate with the correct date in which they happened. One hit will be backdated on every new launch of the application. </p> <p> When disabled, the Adobe SDK will attach the session info to the current lifecycle. </p> </td>
