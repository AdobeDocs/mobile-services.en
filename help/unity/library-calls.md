# Making calls to the library{#making-calls-to-the-library}

When you want to make calls to the plug-in from your scripts, import the namespace:

* **C#:** using `com.adobe.mobile;`

After you import the namespace, you can make calls directly to the plug-in via the static methods of the ADBMobile class.
