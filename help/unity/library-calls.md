# Making calls to the library{#making-calls-to-the-library}

When you want to make calls to the plug-in from your scripts, you must import the namespace.

* **C#:** using *`com.adobe.mobile;`* 

* **JavaScript:** import *`com.adobe.mobile;`* 

* **boo:** import *`com.adobe.mobile;`*

After you have imported the namespace, you can make calls directly to the plug-in via the static methods of the ADBMobile class.
